# Sports-Blog
Welcome to my sports blog where I showcase a web application that utilizes the Express.js API and Sequelize library to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
To install the application, simply clone the repository and run 'node i' to install the necessary dependencies including SQL.

## Usage
Once the application is installed, navigate to the connection file and input your username and password. Then, run 'npm start' in the terminal to start the application. You can now input the information needed to edit the database via the user interface.
